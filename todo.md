## Bugs

* PersistentDuration columns are not properly sortable
* DateTimeZone columns persist as VARBINARY instead of VARCHAR as there is no persistent type

## Backlog

### Next release
* update scaffolding to match Grails 1.4
* optional scaffolding using HTML5 inputs rather than pickers

### Whenever
* Input for DateTime with zone
* allow minutes on dateTimePicker to be restricted, e.g. only allow selection of every 5 minutes
* selection tag for Chronology
* JSON/XML support for Chronology
